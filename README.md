## Project Overview

This project aims to **analyze cognitive skills and predict student performance** using a synthetic student dataset. It combines **data analysis, machine learning, and interactive dashboards** to provide actionable insights into learning patterns.  

Key goals:  
- Understand correlations between cognitive skills and assessment performance.  
- Predict assessment scores using a simple ML model.  
- Cluster students into learning personas for targeted interventions.  
- Visualize insights in a **Next.js dashboard** for easy exploration.

## Dataset

The dataset contains synthetic student records with the following fields:

| Field                | Description                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `student_id`         | Unique student identifier                  |
| `name`               | Student name                               |
| `class`              | Student's class/grade                      |
| `comprehension`      | Cognitive skill score â€“ comprehension     |
| `attention`          | Cognitive skill score â€“ attention         |
| `focus`              | Cognitive skill score â€“ focus             |
| `retention`          | Cognitive skill score â€“ retention         |
| `assessment_score`   | Actual assessment score                   |
| `engagement_time`    | Time spent engaging with learning material|

## Data Analysis & Insights

- **Correlation Analysis:**  
  Strong positive correlations were observed between comprehension, attention, focus, retention, and assessment scores.  
  This indicates that higher cognitive skills generally lead to better performance.  

- **Clustering (Learning Personas):**  
  Students were grouped into clusters representing different learning styles:  
  - High performers with balanced skills  
  - Students with strong attention but low retention  
  - Students needing improvement across multiple skills  

- **Key Findings:**  
  - Engagement time alone does not guarantee high assessment scores.  
  - Retention and comprehension have the highest impact on performance.  
  - Personalized learning strategies can improve overall outcomes.

## Machine Learning

- **Model:** Linear Regression to predict `assessment_score`.  
- **Performance:**  
  - Achieved a good correlation between predicted and actual scores.  
  - Useful for identifying students at risk and suggesting targeted support.

## Dashboard Features

Built with **Next.js**, the dashboard provides:  
- **Overview Stats:** Average scores and cognitive skill summaries.  
- **Charts:**  
  - Bar chart: Skill vs assessment score  
  - Scatter plot: Attention vs performance  
  - Radar chart: Student profile visualization  
- **Student Table:** Searchable and sortable student records.  
- **Insights Section:** Highlights key patterns and clusters.
